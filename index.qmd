I am a science educator and biologist passionate about making science accessible and engaging for everyone. My interests span science communication, molecular immunology, and cell biology. In my teaching, I strive to create inclusive, dynamic learning environments grounded in evidence-based practices.  Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, traveling, and discovering great coffee spots.
