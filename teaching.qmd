# About me


I hold a Master's degree from India and a PhD from the University of British Columbia. My research background is in Chemical Biology. I currently teach undergraduate courses and enjoy combining active learning with clear, well-structured assessments. Outside of teaching I love spending time outdoors, exploring new places, and trying different types of food.

# Teaching philosophy (short)


I focus on clarity, inclusivity, and active learning. I use a mixture of formative assessments and in-class activities to build student confidence and competence. I aim to create an engaging learning environment where students feel supported to explore, ask questions, and practice scientific thinking.
